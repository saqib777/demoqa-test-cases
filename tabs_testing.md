# Tabs Component Testing – DemoQA

## Overview  
Testing the “Tabs” component of the website ensures that the UI element which allows switching between different content sections via tab headers works correctly, reliably and accessibly.

## Test Cases

| # | Test Case Title | Pre-condition | Steps | Expected Result |
|---|------------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Default Tab Selected | Page loaded | 1. Navigate to the Tabs page. <br>2. Observe the initial tab header and content. | The first tab header is highlighted/active and its content panel is visible. |
| 2 | Select Second Tab | Page loaded with default state | 1. Click on the second tab header. | The second tab header becomes active, its content panel is shown; first tab content hides. |
| 3 | Select Third Tab | Page loaded | 1. Click on the third tab header. | Third tab content becomes visible; active tab header updates accordingly. |
| 4 | Keyboard Navigation (Left/Right) | Page loaded | 1. Focus tab headers. <br>2. Press right arrow key. <br>3. Press left arrow key. | Focus shifts correctly through tabs; content updates when selecting via keyboard. |
| 5 | URL/Hash Linking (if supported) | Page loaded | 1. Use direct URL with hash for a tab (if available) <br>2. Reload page. | The appropriate tab is selected automatically based on URL/hashing. |
| 6 | Content Panel Visibility | Tab selected | 1. Select a tab. <br>2. Inspect DOM and visibility properties of other panels. | Only the selected tab’s content is visible; other panels are hidden or not rendered. |
| 7 | Tab Header Styling | Tabs visible | 1. Inspect active/inactive header styling (color, underline, bold, etc) via CSS. | Active header has distinct style; inactive headers have consistent style. |
| 8 | Responsiveness / Mobile View | On a mobile viewport | 1. Resize browser or use mobile device. <br>2. Switch tabs. | Tab headers remain usable/visible; content displays properly; layout does not break. |
| 9 | Edge Case: Rapid Switching | Page loaded | 1. Quickly click multiple different tab headers back-to-back. | No content flicker, lag or incorrect panel shows; component remains stable. |
| 10 | Edge Case: Tab Content Deep Scroll | Tab selected with scrollable content | 1. Select a tab with long content. <br>2. Scroll to bottom. <br>3. Switch to another tab and back. | Scroll position resets (or behaves as expected) when returning to a tab; content remains consistent. |
| 11 | Accessibility – Screen Reader Labels | Page loaded | 1. Use a screen-reader or inspect aria attributes. <br>2. Navigate through tab headers. | Each tab header has appropriate `role="tab"` and content panel has `role="tabpanel"`; `aria-selected` reflects state. |
| 12 | Accessibility – Tab Order | Page loaded | 1. Use keyboard Tab key to navigate. <br>2. Focus on tab headers. | Tab headers are focusable; tabbing order logical and consistent; selecting tab via Enter or Space works. |
| 13 | Error Handling / Missing Content | Page loaded | 1. Simulate or inspect a case where content panel fails to load (if possible). | The UI handles missing content gracefully (e.g., shows placeholder or error message) rather than blank or broken. |
| 14 | Integration with Other Components | Page loaded with Tabs component plus other sections | 1. Use tabs along with other UI elements (e.g., buttons, links) on the same page. | Tabs do not interfere with other components; switching tabs does not break other features. |
| 15 | Styling / Theme Variations | Page loaded under different themes or styling (if available) | 1. Switch theme or style (light/dark). <br>2. Use tabs. | Tab component adapts styling properly; contrast and readability maintained in each theme. |

## Notes and Details  
- **Active Tab Indication**: Ensure the active tab is visually distinct (highlighted background, underline, bold text) for ease of user recognition.  
- **Performance Considerations**: Switching tabs should be near-instant without noticeable lag or flicker — crucial for user experience.  
- **Accessibility**: Remember keyboard navigation, ARIA roles and focus management — tabs are a common accessibility trap.  
- **DOM Behavior**: The content panels of non-selected tabs should either be hidden via CSS or removed from the accessibility tree (e.g., `display: none`, `aria-hidden="true"`).  
- **Mobile / Responsive Behavior**: Tab headers on small screens should remain visible or collapse into a dropdown/scrollable area — test on varied device widths.  
- **Edge Cases**: Rapid switching, extremely long content, missing or unrendered panels, or styling issues under theme changes all represent realistic risks.  
- **Integration Risks**: If the Tabs component is reused across other UI contexts, ensure other scripts or styles don’t break its behavior (ex: nested tabs, third-party plugins).

## End Notes  
Testing of the Tabs component may seem straightforward but it’s deceptively complex when you consider accessibility, responsiveness, performance and integration concerns. A tab component often acts as a gateway — showing different content on the same screen real-estate. Ensuring the user can trust it to work seamlessly, under any condition, is key to good UX and quality design.  
Be sure to revisit these tests whenever visual styling or JavaScript logic changes — regression in tab behavior is easy to overlook.
