| TC ID       | Description                                                         | Pre-condition                 | Steps                                                                                  | Expected Result                                                                 |

| TC_DRG_16   | Drag element and drop exactly at defined coordinate offset          | Page loaded                   | 1. Locate draggable element. <br>2. Drag by offset (e.g., +100px x, +50px y).        | Element moves to correct location; coordinates update accordingly.               |
| TC_DRG_17   | Verify element cannot be dragged outside container boundary         | Page loaded                   | 1. Drag element beyond visible container limits.                                       | Element stops at container edge; no overflow outside.                          |
| TC_DRG_18   | Check revert behaviour if drag cancelled mid-way                    | Page loaded                   | 1. Start dragging element. <br>2. Release mouse outside allowed area.                   | Element returns to original position (if spec).                                 |
| TC_DRG_19   | Verify drag handle cursor changes appearance                        | Hover over draggable element  | 1. Hover over element. <br>2. Check cursor icon.                                        | Cursor changes to “move” or grab icon when draggable.                           |
| TC_DRG_20   | Verify keyboard drag support (if implemented)                       | Page loaded                   | 1. Focus element. <br>2. Use arrow keys to move.                                       | Element moves via keyboard; focus remains; no mouse used.                       |
| TC_DRG_21   | Rapid sequential drag operations                                    | Page loaded                   | 1. Drag element to various positions repeatedly (5–10 times).                          | No lag; element consistently moves; position updates each time.                 |
| TC_DRG_22   | Check touch/drag behaviour on mobile view                           | Browser resized/mobile device | 1. Use touch drag on element.                                                         | Element moves correctly with touch; UI remains responsive.                      |
| TC_DRG_23   | Verify drag behaviour after page resize                              | Page loaded                   | 1. Resize window. <br>2. Drag element to new position.                                 | Drag still works; position relative to container adjusted correctly.             |
| TC_DRG_24   | Verify z-index or layering when draggable overlaps other elements    | Page contains overlapping UI   | 1. Drag element across overlapping elements.                                           | Draggable remains on top; no visual clipping or wrong layering.                 |
| TC_DRG_25   | Verify boundary/containment box is visually highlighted during drag   | Page loaded                   | 1. Begin drag. <br>2. Observe boundary highlight (if spec).                             | The boundary or container shows visual cue; behaviour correct during drag.      |
| TC_DRG_26   | Verify state persistence after drag and refresh                      | Element moved                  | 1. Move element. <br>2. Refresh page.                                                 | If spec: element returns to initial position; or new position persists.         |
| TC_DRG_27   | Verify invalid drag behaviour (e.g., drag handle partially)          | Page loaded                   | 1. Try dragging by clicking on non-handle area (if parts are non-draggable).            | Drag not initiated or behaviour prevented appropriately.                         |
| TC_DRG_28   | Verify axis-restricted drag movement (if Only X / Only Y supported)  | Page has X/Y restriction       | 1. Select “Only X” drag mode (if available). <br>2. Try moving in Y direction.           | Y movement restricted; only X movement allowed.                                 |
| TC_DRG_29   | Verify container scrolling during drag when element near edge        | Long scrollable container      | 1. Drag element near container bottom. <br>2. Observe scroll triggered.                 | Container scrolls automatically; element still draggable and drops correctly.   |
| TC_DRG_30   | Verify element snapping/grid alignment after drag (if implemented)    | Page supports snap/grid         | 1. Drag element to arbitrary position. <br>2. Release.                                  | Element snaps to nearest grid or alignment line as per spec.                    |
