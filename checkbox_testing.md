## Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
|--------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| CB_01 | Verify that the main checkbox expands all options when clicked. | 1. Go to the page. <br> 2. Click the dropdown arrow next to "Home". | All nested checkboxes should expand and be visible. |
| CB_02 | Verify selecting the root checkbox selects all child checkboxes. | 1. Click the "Home" checkbox. | All nested checkboxes under "Home" should be automatically checked. |
| CB_03 | Verify deselecting the root checkbox clears all child checkboxes. | 1. Check "Home". <br> 2. Uncheck "Home". | All nested checkboxes should be unchecked. |
| CB_04 | Verify selecting an intermediate node checkbox (e.g., "Desktop") selects its children. | 1. Expand "Home". <br> 2. Click "Desktop". | Both "Notes" and "Commands" checkboxes should be checked. |
| CB_05 | Verify deselecting an intermediate node clears its children. | 1. Select "Desktop". <br> 2. Unselect "Desktop". | "Notes" and "Commands" should be unchecked. |
| CB_06 | Verify individual leaf node selection works correctly. | 1. Expand "Desktop". <br> 2. Select only "Notes". | Only "Notes" should be checked. |
| CB_07 | Verify partially selected parent node is displayed correctly. | 1. Expand "Desktop". <br> 2. Select "Notes" only. | "Desktop" checkbox should show partially checked state. |
| CB_08 | Verify text output updates according to selected checkboxes. | 1. Select "Documents". <br> 2. Observe the output below the checkbox tree. | Selected checkbox names should be displayed correctly. |
| CB_09 | Verify that expanding and collapsing nodes works consistently. | 1. Expand "Home". <br> 2. Collapse "Home". | Checkboxes toggle visibility without losing state. |
| CB_10 | Verify state persistence on multiple actions. | 1. Select "Documents". <br> 2. Collapse "Home". <br> 3. Expand "Home" again. | Previously selected checkboxes remain checked. |
| CB_11 | Verify multiple selections across different branches. | 1. Select "Desktop > Notes". <br> 2. Select "Documents > Word File". | Both checkboxes remain selected independently. |
| CB_12 | Verify deselecting a child updates the parent state correctly. | 1. Select "Desktop". <br> 2. Deselect "Notes". | "Desktop" should show partially checked state. |
| CB_13 | Verify that the UI handles long click or double click. | 1. Double click on "Home" checkbox. | Only one click action should be triggered, not multiple toggles. |
| CB_14 | Verify responsiveness on different screen sizes. | 1. Resize the browser window (mobile/tablet). | Checkboxes and expand/collapse arrows should remain usable and aligned. |
| CB_15 | Verify accessibility with keyboard navigation. | 1. Use **Tab** and **Space/Enter** to navigate and toggle checkboxes. | All checkboxes should be accessible and selectable via keyboard. |

## Notes

-  **Selection Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships should remain consistent â€” selecting a parent selects all children, and partial selection is reflected visually.  
-  **Partial State**: Parents should clearly indicate when only some children are selected.  
-  **Output Accuracy**: The selected checkbox list must match user interactions in real-time.  
-  **Persistence**: State should remain unchanged after collapsing/expanding.  
-  **Usability**: Actions like double click or long click must not cause duplicate behavior.  
-  **Cross-Device Testing**: Ensure the checkbox tree works correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop views.  
-  **Accessibility**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation, and focus states must be supported.  
-  **Performance**: Expanding/collapsing nodes should be smooth, even with multiple selections.  
-  **Edge Cases**: Test rapid clicks, selecting/deselecting quickly, or using unusual input patterns.
