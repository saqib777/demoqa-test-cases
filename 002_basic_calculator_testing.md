## Notes & Explanations  
- This page offers **basic arithmetic operations** plus a **concatenation mode** where inputs are treated as strings.  
- The “Integers only” toggle limits results to integer outputs when enabled.  
- Input validation is essential — non-numeric input in numeric modes must be handled safely.  
- UI behaviour under mode switching, viewport resizing, keyboard navigation, and large value operations should all be verified.

## End Notes  
Though simple in appearance, the Basic Calculator application introduces various functional and non-functional test concerns: numeric vs string mode, error conditions (like division by zero or invalid input), UI responsiveness, mode toggles, and accessibility.  
Covering these scenarios helps ensure reliability, correct handling of edge cases, and a solid user experience.
