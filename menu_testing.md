# Menu Component Testing – DemoQA

## Overview  
Testing the “Menu” component ensures that the nested menu structure (main items, sub-items, sub-sub items) behaves correctly: each item is clickable, navigation works properly, and user experience (including keyboard and accessibility) is maintained.

## Test Cases

| #  | Test Case Title                           | Pre-condition           | Steps                                                       | Expected Result |
|----|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 1  | Default Menu Visible                     | Page loaded              | 1. Navigate to the Menu page. <br>2. Observe main menu items. | The main menu items (“Main Item 1”, “Main Item 2”, “Main Item 3”) are visible. |
| 2  | Click First Main Item                     | Page loaded              | 1. Click “Main Item 1”.                                       | Sub-items under Main Item 1 become visible (if any). |
| 3  | Click Second Main Item                    | Page loaded              | 1. Click “Main Item 2”.                                       | Sub-menu opens, list of sub-items visible, previous menu closes. |
| 4  | Navigate to Sub-Item & Trigger Action     | Main item opened         | 1. Click “Sub Item” under Main Item 2.                         | Correct link/action occurs; menu state updates accordingly. |
| 5  | Navigate to Sub-Sub-Item                  | Sub-menu opened          | 1. Hover or click “SUB SUB LIST »”. <br>2. Click “Sub Sub Item 1”. | Panel or link triggered; highlight state correct. |
| 6  | Hover Behavior                            | Page loaded              | 1. Mouse over “Main Item 3”.                                  | Hover state changes (background or underline); submenu stays hidden if none. |
| 7  | Keyboard Navigation (Tab + Arrow Keys)    | Focus on menu bar        | 1. Press Tab until menu gets focus.<br>2. Use arrow keys.      | Focus moves through menu items; submenus open/close via keyboard; Enter selects. |
| 8  | Mobile/Small Viewport Behavior            | Browser resized          | 1. Resize to mobile width.<br>2. Interact with menu.           | Menu remains usable; items don’t overlap; hierarchical items still accessible. |
| 9  | Deep Hierarchy & Overlap Test             | Sub-sub menu present     | 1. Navigate deep into “Sub Sub Item 2”.                       | No visual overflow or hidden items; all levels visible/clickable. |
| 10 | Content Persistence After Navigation       | Link clicked in menu     | 1. Click a menu item that loads a new page. <br>2. Use browser back. | Returning to menu retains correct state or resets logically. |
| 11 | Accessibility – ARIA roles & states        | Page loaded              | 1. Inspect menu DOM & attributes.                             | Each menu item with role=“menuitem”, submenus with proper aria-expanded, aria-haspopup attributes. |
| 12 | Disabled/Hidden Items Behavior (if any)    | None                     | 1. Attempt to click disabled/hidden menu items.               | Disabled items cannot be clicked; hidden items not shown or accessible. |
| 13 | Right-Click Context (if applicable)       | Menu loaded              | 1. Right click on menu item (if context menu enabled).         | Context menu appears as expected or behaves gracefully. |
| 14 | Performance – Menu Load & Switching        | Page loaded              | 1. Open and close sub-menus back-to-back.                      | No perceptible lag, menu transitions fluid, no flicker. |
| 15 | Style & Theme Variation                    | Theme switch (if any)    | 1. Switch theme/light-dark (if supported). <br>2. Open menu.   | Menu styling adapts (color/contrast); readability maintained. |

## Notes and Details  
- **Hierarchy Handling:** Some menu items might have nested sub-menus (e.g., “SUB SUB LIST »”). Ensure all levels open correctly and visually.  
- **Focus & Keyboard Support:** A well-designed menu supports keyboard navigation — arrow keys should move focus, Enter/Space should activate items, Esc should close submenus if open.  
- **ARIA & Accessibility:** Use roles and states (`role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"`, `aria-haspopup="true"`, `aria-expanded="false/true"`) to support assistive technologies.  
- **Responsive Behavior:** On smaller screens, menu items should still be visible and CR-UX should not degrade: items should not overflow or cut off.  
- **Edge Cases:** Rapid interaction, nested menu toggles, very deep hierarchies, theme changes, hidden or disabled menu items — all can cause bugs.  
- **Integration Risks:** If the menu is part of a larger layout, its open state should not break other page elements or overlap unexpectedly.

## End Notes  
Menus are a foundational component for navigation and user experience. While they may appear simple, their correct behavior under all conditions (accessibility, responsiveness, performance, hierarchy) is vital. Ensuring robust test coverage helps avoid subtle issues like inaccessible items, focus traps, styling glitches, or broken navigation flows.
